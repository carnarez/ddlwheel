**Database objects lineage visualization via [`D3.js`](https://github.com/d3/d3).** Get
it via a simple:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/carnarez/ddlwheel@master
```

Due to its [cleaner type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) `Python`
v3.10 is required. This little DIY is fully
[tested](https://github.com/carnarez/ddlwheel/actions/workflows/test.yaml) (100%
coverage).
